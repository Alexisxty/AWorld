# AWorld

> **Build, evaluate and run General Multi-Agent Assistance with ease**

Through AWorld (short for Agent World), you can quickly build real-world scenarios or task automation into agentic prototypes, then extend them into a generic agent or a team of agents to assist your real needs, like Manus.

*Hope AWorld would guide you into the AGI World. GLHF!*
